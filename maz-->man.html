	<textarea name="text" class="maz">Much later I thought I’d escaped the movie but it’s turned in to Aliens part 7 and I’ve been abducted by my own desires.

I call the Samaritans hotline. A nice Welsh man answers. There is a long pause on the line and then we both start talking at the same time.

I instantly regret the call but I feel like if I hang up he’ll think I’ve gone and topped myself (sometimes I wish I could top myself - lol - the gays scream). I try to simulate the impression that he’s successfully talking me down. He asks me what my hobbies are and I start sobbing.

- I - make - music - with - computers.

Computers! He says, How do you do that?!

Oh, I don’t know

What kind of music?

Synth pop, I guess

What’s that then? Synth pop? Try saying that with a lisp!

I’m really feeling a lot better now, I say

Oh really?

Mmm, yep I think I just need to sleep

Oh, ok are you sure? You know it’s important to remember that a lot of people feel like this. I think it’s maybe (rustling of papers) 1 in 3 people that have a mental health issue... at some point in their... life

I feel like I’m stuck in another of those conversations with men where they won’t let you leave, and look how polite I’m being despite the potential for suicide. I pull out the big guns - I start talking about capitalism.

Oh, I wouldn’t know about that. Have you tried - mindfulness?

I’m going to sleep now bye bye bye bye bye bye byebyebyebyebye, I shout and put on an episode of Riverdale to fall asleep to. Often I wonder if, on my deathbed, I’ll regret rewatching Riverdale 4 times? But these are the thoughts that come to me in my own death bed simulation, when I’ve taken to my rooms like a Victorian child, duvet up to my chin and crumbs everywhere. At least if I was dead I wouldn’t have to think about dying all the time.

Riverdale is too scintillating so I put on Brooklyn 99. ACAB.

I wake up again at 4pm and still feel like shit. Like how I used to feel on a comedown and I haven’t done any illegal drugs for 2 years. I google long term side effects of mephedrone.

I wait til 5pm and then drag myself out of bed and in to the bits of uniform I find on the floor. It’s ok because everyone at work thinks I’m just accidentally ugly rather than gender confused and depressed.

One day I went in wearing eyeshadow and everyone was so nice to me, I couldn’t cope with how nice they were all being. I was very careful about wearing eyeshadow after that.

I focus instead on cultivating a natural glow. I wipe the rosewater on my face with bog roll which, I don’t know, and I moisturise twice daily. I got totally topped at the Body Shop by this woman who had no eye bags at all and she told me I had dry lined skin so I bought things from her. I put all kinds of shit on my eye bags to make them go away. I think that if my dark circles go, it will trick
my brain in to feeling less tired.

Like I read somewhere that Botox can treat depression because it stops you from frowning, expressing negative emotion. The same principle as fake smiling and laughing to get a dopamine hit. There was a huge robbery of a Botox warehouse in Essex last year and I like to think theres a few less depressed women in Essex now. I wanted to make a film about that but I was worried it sounded a bit too much like fucking Fight Club.

(If you are a film funding person watching this, don’t listen to me, the Botox heist film is very much on the cards. It’s gonna be about a team of trans guerrillas who team up with Essex Mums to steal a whole load of hormones, Botox and fillers. It’s gonna tick all your diversity boxes and it’s gonna bring everyone together, it’s gonna make cis people look really good! It’s gonna be like Pride but in the future present. The only question is, can Imelda Staunton do an Essex accent? Please give me money)

At work, my favourite thing is checking the fire exits. I wonder what would happen if there was a fire. Would I calmly follow protocol or freak out? My grandma was very good in a crisis, because she was nuts too. There’s something about a terrible situation that puts anxiety to rest - I told you so. I’d like to think I’d be that way too, so my tombstone can read ‘Marianne Murray - good in a crisis’ rather than ‘Marianne Murray - killed in unexplained shark attack at a leisure centre’

That’s if I even have a tombstone - oh god. (video of adverts for cheap burials?)

In the fire exits, there’s no one there but me, and nothing to do but walk - and sing.

(Singing videos)

I really really wish I could sing well. I think I like these videos because you can tell that. Sorry if this is getting too self referential, I finished reading I Love Dick the other day, 2 full years out of art school. Fuck. I put off reading it because everyone was and I’m an arsehole. But I Stan a heterosexual icon.

I’ve been reading tales of heterosexual female woe (to remind myself it could be worse) outside the doors when I’m on shift, but people keep interrupting me

Hi, hi, sorry, where abouts is the toilet?

Toilet?

Where’s the ladies?

Gents anywhere?

Which way is it to the ladies?

Can you tell me where the toilets are?

Have you got a toilet?

Hi, sorry, I need a piss

Me, pointing
